**Why Django should be used**

Narration:

Django is a web framework written using the Python Language. It's robust, easy to start with and has a lot of pre-built features available out of the box for someone who already knows how to develop stuff with Python.

It allows the web developer to have a basic application up and running in reasonable time.
