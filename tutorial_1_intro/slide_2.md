**What is a Web Framework**

Narration: 

When building a web application, we need to take care of number of things.
	- How to implement basic security measures like login
	- How the web application will interact with databases to store information
	- How will the HTML pages be rendered
	- and many more

A lot of these situations can be handled by a programmer by coding his own solutions, but that would take a lot of time and effort on his behalf. Web frameworks provide these basic features out-of-the-box.
