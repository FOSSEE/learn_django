  - A web application is an application that is stored on a remote computer on the internet that can be accessed by a 		user through a web browser
  - A user communicates with the server by sending a 'request' through a browser
  - This 'request' contains essential information/data or commands
  - The web application accepts the 'request'
  - It carries out actions as per the information provided within the request
  - It uses a 'database' to as means of storing and manipulating information that may be required for the user in the 		future
  - The web application can read from, add to, delete from OR update the information in the database
  - After the web application has completed carrying out actions, it sends a response to the user
  - The user's browser then displays this response
