**What is a web application**

Narration: 

When the internet started, websites were simple they contained simple text. As time went by and the web became better, websites were able to display multimedia content. Eventually people could run complete applications on the web with just their browsers.

This was possible by transmitting information from the users to remote computers called servers through the internet. The application was installed and executed on these servers

The server-side application stored all kinds of information using databases, so that it could retrieve, modify or utilise this information at any time.

Gmail, Facebook and even Train ticket booking systems are examples of web applications.
