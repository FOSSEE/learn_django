**What is a web application**

Narration: 

When the internet started, websites were simple they contained simple text. As time went by and the web became better, websites were able to display multimedia content. Eventually people could run complete applications on the web with just their browsers.

This was possible by transmitting information from the users to remote computers called servers through the internet. The application was installed and executed on these servers

The server-side application stored all kinds of information using databases, so that it could retrieve, modify or utilise this information at any time.

Gmail, Facebook and even Train ticket booking systems are examples of web applications.

**What is a Web Framework**

Narration: 

When building a web application, we need to take care of number of things.
	- How to implement basic security measures like login
	- How the web application will interact with databases to store information
	- How will the HTML pages be rendered
	- and many more

A lot of these situations can be handled by a programmer by coding his own solutions, but that would take a lot of time and effort on his behalf. Web frameworks provide these basic features out-of-the-box.

**Why Django should be used**

Narration:

Django is a web framework written using the Python Language. It's robust, easy to start with and has a lot of pre-built features available out of the box for someone who already knows how to develop stuff with Python.

It allows the web developer to have a basic application up and running in reasonable time.
